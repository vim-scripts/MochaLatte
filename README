A warm dark-background color scheme for Vim, featuring dynamic control of brightness-levels as needed.

Brighten select (normal and syntax) colors with ":MochalatteBrighten", or darken them with ":MochalatteDarken". Conveniently bound to "META-2" and "META-1", respectively, but you can, of course, suppress the key mappings and/or replace them with others of your own preference.

NOTE: GUI Vim only at the present time.
